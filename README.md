This game was created by myself and 3 other team members over the course of about 5 weeks as part of a software engineering course (CISC 275). The game was made
with a client in mind (Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve) and had to follow certain requirements/restrictions. As part of the course, the structure
of the application had to follow the MVC design pattern.

Sound design was not included as part of the requirements.

General structure: 3 minigames. Game 1 - 2D side scroller, game 2 - tower defense-esque game, game 3 - "story cubes" implementation.

The course mandated that the application be developed in Eclipse, which automatically handles the building of the application. Unfortunately, this means in order to run the game you'll need to have Eclipse or a similar IDE installed (JRE should be 1.8 or later), as no make/build files were created for this application.
