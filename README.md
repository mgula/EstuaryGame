This game was created by myself and 3 other team members over the course of about 5 weeks as part of a software engineering course (CISC 275). The game was made
with a client in mind (Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve) and had to follow certain requirements/restrictions. As part of the course, the structure
of the application had to follow the MVC design pattern.

Sound design was not included as part of the requirements.

General structure: 3 minigames. Game 1 - 2D side scroller, game 2 - tower defense-esque game, game 3 - "story cubes" implementation.

This application was created in Eclipse, which for some reason makes it very difficult to produce executables (sorry). To run it for yourself, you'll also need 
Eclipse (I used Luna): download/clone the repository, then in Eclipse navigate File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace -> from archive file -> 
EstuaryGame.zip from the zip folder of the clone/download. You'll need your JRE to be 1.8 or later.
